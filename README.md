## Overview

A JetBrains IntelliJ plugin for interacting with Tekton Pipelines. This plugin is currently in Preview Mode.

### Running Kubernetes and OpenShift Clusters to use with plugin

To use the plugin, developers can deploy Tekton Pipelines into a Red Hat CodeReady Containers or Minikube instance.

* OpenShift 4.x - [CodeReadyContainers](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned)
* Kubernetes - [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

The plugin also supports OpenShift running on Azure, AWS. 

## Tekton Pipelines Tutorial

To get started with Tekton and learn how to create and run a simple pipeline for building and deploying containerized app on Kubernetes/OpenShift 
you can follow one of these tutorials:

* [Tekton Pipelines Tutorial](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md)
* [OpenShift Pipelines Tutorial](https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial)

## Commands and features

Development of the Tekton Pipelines Plugin is largely following development of the [tkn CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli) as well as 
Tekton Pipelines which are both under active development and potentially subject to drastic changes.

Below you can find a list of the current actions supported by this plugin to interact with Tekton Pipelines. 
These are accessible via the context menu when right-clicking an item in the tree.

#### Actions available for a Tekton Pipeline/Task/ClusterTask/Resource

   * `New` - Open an editor with a configuration sample to create a new pipeline/task/clusterTask/resource.
   * `Open in Editor` - Open the existing pipeline/task/clusterTask/resource configuration in an editor.
   * `Start` - Start a pipeline/task with user indicated input/output resources and parameters.
   * `Delete` - Delete the selected pipeline/task/clusterTask/resource.
   * `Refresh` - Refresh the selected item
   * `Show Logs` - Show a dialog to choose the pipelineRun/taskRun to print logs for (only available for Pipeline/Task)

#### Actions available for an PipelineRun/TaskRun

   * `Show Logs` - Print logs for the selected PipelineRun/TaskRun

##### Saving Process

The plugin takes advantage of the normal saving workflow of the IntelliJ IDE. When you finish to edit your configuration
and want to push the changes to the cluster, click on `Save All (CTRL + S)`. A prompt will be shown asking if you want to push the changes.

### Dependencies

#### CLI Tools

This plugin uses a CLI tool to interact with Tekton Pipelines:
* Tekton CLI - [tkn](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli)

> The plugin will detect these dependencies and prompt the user to install if they are missing or have not supported version - choose `Download & Install` when you see an notification for the missing tool.

**NOTE:** This plugin is in Preview mode. The plugin support for Tekton is strictly experimental - assumptions may break, commands and behavior may change!
